Optilab is a lightweight and flexible python framework for testing black-box optimization.

## Features
- âœ… Intuitive interface to quickly prototype and run optimizers and metamodels.
- ðŸ“š High quality documentation.
- ðŸ“ˆ Objective functions, optimizers, plotting and data handling.
- â‹™ CLI functionality to easily summarize results of previous experiments.
- ðŸš€ Multiprocessing for faster computation.

## How to install
Optilab has been tested to work on python versions 3.11 and above. To install it from PyPI, run:
```
pip install optilab
```
You can also install from source by cloning this repo and running:
```
make install
```

## CLI tool
Optilab comes with a powerful CLI tool to easily summarize your experiments. It allows for plotting the results and performing statistical testing to check for statistical significance in optimization results.
```
usage: python -m optilab [-h] [--aggregate_pvalues] [--aggregate_stats]
                         [--entries ENTRIES [ENTRIES ...]] [--hide_outliers]
                         [--hide_plots] [--no_save] [--raw_values]
                         [--save_path SAVE_PATH] [--test_evals] [--test_y]
                         pickle_path

Optilab CLI utility.

positional arguments:
  pickle_path           Path to pickle file or directory with optimization runs.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --aggregate_pvalues   Aggregate pvalues of stat tests against run 0 in each pickle
                        file into one table.
  --aggregate_stats     Aggregate median and iqr for all processed runs into one table.
  --entries ENTRIES [ENTRIES ...]
                        Space separated list of indexes of entries to include in
                        analysis.
  --hide_outliers       If specified, outliers will not be shown in the box plot.
  --hide_plots          Hide plots when running the script.
  --no_save             If specified, no artifacts will be saved.
  --raw_values          If specified, y values below tolerance are not substituted by
                        tolerance value.
  --save_path SAVE_PATH
                        Path to directory to save the artifacts. Default is the user's
                        working directory.
  --test_evals          Perform Mann-Whitney U test on eval values.
  --test_y              Perform Mann-Whitney U test on y values.
```
