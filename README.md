## CLI tool
Optilab comes with a powerful CLI tool to easily summarize your experiments. It allows for plotting the results and performing statistical testing to check for statistical significance in optimization results.
```
usage: python -m optilab [-h] [--hide_plots] [--test_y] [--test_evals] [--entries ENTRIES [ENTRIES ...]] [--raw_values] [--hide_outliers] [--no_save] pickle_path

Optilab CLI utility.

positional arguments:
  pickle_path           Path to pickle file or directory with optimization runs.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --hide_plots          Hide plots when running the script.
  --test_y              Perform Mann-Whitney U test on y values.
  --test_evals          Perform Mann-Whitney U test on eval values.
  --entries ENTRIES [ENTRIES ...]
                        Space separated list of indexes of entries to include in analysis.
  --raw_values          If specified, y values below tolerance are not substituted by tolerance value.
  --hide_outliers       If specified, outliers will not be shown in the box plot.
  --no_save             If specified, no artifacts will be saved.
